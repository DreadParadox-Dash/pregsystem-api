# Setup
Keep in mind that the Patient Registration System is created with MySql in mind. Although other RDBMS can be used, we advise to setup up a MySql database to avoid bugs and other issues.

- clone the repository
- create a database in MySQL
- modify .env to connect to the created database
- ensure that you'll be using port 8000 and localhost.
- open terminal within the repository and run 'php artisan serve'
